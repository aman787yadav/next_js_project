# 📝 Next.js Task Manager - CRUD App

This is a **Task Manager** web application built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).  
It allows users to perform **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks.

Each task contains a **title** and a **description**, making it useful for managing to-do lists, personal goals, or project tasks.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Create new tasks with a title and description
- 📋 View all added tasks
- ✏️ Edit task details
- ❌ Delete tasks
- ⚡ Instant updates using modern React and Next.js features

- **React** – For building interactive UI
- **Tailwind CSS** *(optional)* – For modern and responsive styling
